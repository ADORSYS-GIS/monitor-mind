# SysPulse: Automated System Monitoring Tool

## Overview
SysPulse is an automated tool designed to monitor various system metrics such as CPU usage, RAM, SWAP, Disk Usage, and network statistics. This tool provides real-time insights into system performance and alerts users about potential issues. Developed as a collaborative project by students, SysPulse aims to combine the power of Python with Unix/Bash scripting for efficient system monitoring.

## Features
- **CPU Monitoring**: Track CPU usage to detect periods of high usage.
- **Memory Monitoring**: Monitor RAM and SWAP usage to manage system memory resources.
- **Disk Usage Monitoring**: Keep an eye on disk space usage to prevent storage issues.
- **Process Tracking**: List and monitor all active processes in the system.
- **Network Statistics**: (Optional) Monitor network usage and traffic.
- **Alert System**: Receive notifications for critical metric thresholds.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: View real-time data through a web-based dashboard.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Store and view historical data for trend analysis.
