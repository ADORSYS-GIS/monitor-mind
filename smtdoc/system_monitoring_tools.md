# System Monitoring Tool Documentation

## Introduction
The System Monitoring Tool is a Python-based application designed to monitor various aspects of a system and provide real-time information for analysis and troubleshooting. This tool utilizes Python libraries and modules to gather system statistics and generate reports for monitoring purposes.

## Features
1. CPU Monitoring: The tool tracks CPU usage, including overall usage percentage and individual core usage. It provides real-time updates and historical data for analysis.

2. Memory Monitoring: The tool monitors memory usage, including total memory, available memory, and memory usage by processes. It helps identify memory-intensive processes and potential memory leaks.

3. Disk Monitoring: The tool monitors disk usage, including total disk space, available space, and usage by individual disks or partitions. It alerts when disk space reaches a specified threshold.

4. Network Monitoring: The tool tracks network usage, including incoming and outgoing data rates, packet loss, and latency. It helps identify network bottlenecks and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

5. Process Monitoring: The tool monitors running processes, providing information such as CPU and memory usage, process IDs, and resource utilization. It allows users to manage and terminate processes if necessary.

6. Logging and Alerting: The tool logs system monitoring data and generates alerts based on predefined thresholds. It can send email notifications or trigger custom actions when specific conditions are met.

7. Historical Data Analysis: The tool stores monitoring data in a database, allowing users to analyze historical trends and generate reports for capacity planning and performance optimization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
shell
   git clone https://github.com/ADORSYS-GIS/monitor-mind.git
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Customize the configuration file to specify monitoring intervals, alert thresholds, and notification settings.

4. Run the tool using the following command:
shell
   python3 system_monitor.py
## Configuration
The configuration file ( `config.ini` ) allows customization of various settings for the System Monitoring Tool. Some key configurable parameters include:

- Monitoring intervals for CPU, memory, disk, and network.
- Alert thresholds for CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and network latency.
- Email notification settings, including SMTP server details and recipient addresses.
- Database configuration for storing monitoring data.

Please refer to the provided documentation or comments within the configuration file for detailed instructions on modifying these settings.

## Usage
Once the tool is up and running, it will continuously monitor the system and provide real-time updates. Users can access the monitoring data and reports through the tool's web interface or API endpoints.

The web interface provides a user-friendly dashboard displaying key system metrics and graphs. Users can navigate through different sections to view detailed information about CPU, memory, disk, network, and processes. It also allows users to configure alerts, manage processes, and generate reports.

Alternatively, users can interact with the tool programmatically by utilizing the provided API endpoints. These endpoints allow fetching system statistics, managing processes, and retrieving historical data for analysis.

Please refer to the tool's API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints and their usage.
