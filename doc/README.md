# HISTORICAL DATA STORAGE AND VIEWING

The goal of this issue is to achieve storing of data historical data of system metrics and viewing them for analysis and decision-making.
This is an implementation of a comprehensive system monitoring and data storage solution.

# System Metrics that are being monitored include:
- * CPU Usage *: The percentage of CPU being used by the system or individual processes.
- * Memory Usage*: The percentage of Memory being used by the system or individual processes.
- * Disk Usage*: The amount of disk space being used by the system or individual processes.
- * Network traffic*: The amount of data being sent and received over the network.
- * System Uptime*: The length of time the system has been running without being restarted.
- * Load average*: The average number of processes in the system's run queue over a period of time.
- * Process count*: The number of running processing in the system.
- * Application response times*: The time it takes for an application to respond to user requests or perform specific tasks. 
- * System logs*: he records of system events and activities that are stored by the operating system or applications.
- * Security events*: The records of security-related events, such as login attempts, access violations, or malware detections.

# Monitoring tool
The chosen monitoring tool is ** Prometheus **

# Data Storage Solution
I have chosen to use ** Prometheus ** to store data.
